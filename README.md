### Competitive Programming Archive
A collection of semi-organized contests I've participated or trained on and my attempts at solving them.
This is just an archive of my, sometimes unfinished, solutions so don't expect every code here to be AC in judge.
This was also **not** curated so many files might be empty or not relate to the contest folder at all.
